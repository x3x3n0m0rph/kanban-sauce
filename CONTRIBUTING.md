## Development

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a branch from `main`:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and verify they work:

   ```sh
   pnpm lint
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Commit your changes with a clear message:

   ```
   feat: add drag-and-drop reordering within columns
   fix: prevent duplicate feature IDs on rapid creation
   ```

   We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.).

4. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.
