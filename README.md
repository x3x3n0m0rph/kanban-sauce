Features are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter — version-controllable, diffable, and editable outside the extension. No accounts, no external services.

## Quick Start

1. **Install** — search "Kanban Markdown" in the Extensions view ([VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LachyFS.kanban-markdown) / [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/LachyFS/kanban-markdown))
2. **Open** — run `Open Kanban Board` from the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. **Create** — press `N` to add your first feature card

## Features

### Multiple Kanban Boards

You can create and open multiple independent kanban boards inside the same workspace:
- **Open any folder**: Right-click any folder in the VS Code Explorer file tree and select **Open as Kanban Board**. A dedicated board tab will open for that directory path.
- **Select Board**: Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and choose **Select Kanban Board** to pick from a list of previously opened boards.
- **Run multiple simultaneously**: You can open two or more kanban boards side-by-side! Each tab will dynamically track and update cards for its specific directory path.

### Board & Workflow

- 5-column workflow — Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done (customizable)
- Drag-and-drop between columns and within columns
- Sidebar view from the activity bar
- Split-view editor — board on left, inline editor on right
- Horizontal and vertical layouts
- Compact mode for dense boards
- Keyboard shortcuts — `N` new feature, `Esc` close dialogs, `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` submit

### Cards

Each card is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LachyFS/kanban-markdown-vscode-extension/main/docs/images/board-overview.png" alt="Kanban Board Overview" width="800" />
</div>

- Priority levels — Critical, High, Medium, Low with color-coded badges
- Assignees
- Due dates with smart formatting (Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, "5d", etc.)
- Labels — multiple per card, shows up to 3 with "+X more"
- Automatic created/modified timestamps
- Archive completed features to keep the board clean

### Search & Filtering

- Full-text search across content, IDs, assignees, and labels
- Filter by priority, assignee, label, or due date
- Due date filters — overdue, today, this week, or no date

### Editor Integration

- Rich text editing with Tiptap
- Inline frontmatter editing — dropdowns for status/priority, inputs for assignee/due date/labels
- Auto-save on change
- Auto-refresh when files change externally
- Native markdown mode — open files in VS Code's built-in editor instead
- Follows your VS Code/Cursor theme (light & dark)

## AI Agent Integration

Cards include a "Build with AI" action that passes full feature context (title, priority, labels, description) to your preferred agent.

| Agent | Modes |
|-------|-------|
| Claude Code | Default, Plan, Auto-edit, Full Auto |
| Codex | Suggest, Auto-edit, Full Auto |
| GitHub Copilot | Default |
| OpenCode | Default |

### Kanban Skill

Give agents read/write access to your board from the terminal:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/LachyFS/kanban-skill
```

Compatible with Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)-compatible agents. See [kanban-skill](https://github.com/LachyFS/kanban-skill) for details.

## File Format

Features live in `.devtool/features/` by default, organized into subfolders by status.

```markdown
---
id: "implement-dark-mode-toggle-2026-01-25"
status: "todo"
priority: "high"
assignee: "john"
dueDate: "2026-01-25"
created: "2026-01-25T10:30:00.000Z"
modified: "2026-01-25T14:20:00.000Z"
labels: ["feature", "ui"]
order: 0

]
```

## Installation

### VS Code Marketplace

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LachyFS.kanban-markdown) or search "Kanban Markdown" in the Extensions view.

### Open VSX (VSCodium, Cursor, etc.)

Install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/LachyFS/kanban-markdown) or search "Kanban Markdown" in the Extensions view.

### From VSIX

1. Download the `.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/LachyFS/kanban-markdown-vscode-extension/releases)
2. In VS Code: Extensions > `...` > Install from VSIX
3. Select the downloaded file

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install       # Install dependencies
pnpm dev           # Start development (watch mode)
pnpm build         # Build for production
pnpm typecheck     # Type checking
pnpm lint          # Linting
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit + component tests (fast, no VS Code host required)
pnpm test

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Integration tests (launches a real VS Code instance)
pnpm test:integration
```

Unit tests cover shared logic, extension utilities, and React components. Integration tests run inside a VS Code host using `@vscode/test-electron` and exercise the real file system and VS Code APIs.

#### Running the CI pipeline locally with `act`

[`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) runs GitHub Actions workflows locally in Docker.

```bash
# Install (macOS)
brew install act

# Run the full CI test job
act push -j test --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

The first run downloads a VS Code binary (~160 MB) into `.vscode-test/` which is cached for subsequent runs.

### Debugging

1. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host
2. Open the command palette and run "Open Kanban Board"
3. Make changes and reload the window (`Cmd+R`) to see updates

### Tech Stack

**Extension**: TypeScript, VS Code API, esbuild | **Webview**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Tiptap
